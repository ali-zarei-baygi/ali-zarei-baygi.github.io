* Implemented pseudo labeling algorithms to assign more fine-grained intents for MultiWOZ dataset [RASA DIET classifier]

* Improved pseudo labeling accuracy by comparing sentence embeddings [Sentence-BERT, Hugging Face]

* Combined data augmentation (character replacement, synonym replacement, and paraphrase generation) with pseudo labeling to improve performance of DIET classifier [nlpaug, T5, Hugging Face]
