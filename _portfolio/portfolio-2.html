* Developed artificial intelligent (AI) agents (using random forest, and Q-learning) for trading stocks (time series data) [Python]


* Evaluated several trading technical indicators (such as SMA, EMA, and RSI) as the input features/states for training the AI agents


* Improved performance of the AI agents on creating buy/sell stock signals using roll forward cross-validation
