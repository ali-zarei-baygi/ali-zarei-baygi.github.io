# Personal Summary

I am a computer scientist with **Machine Learning** specialization at *Georgia Institute of Technology*. I am passionate about **Deep Learning, Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Data Analysis**. Through working on a variety of projects across the areas of Deep Learning, I have been able to elevate my skills in data preprocessing, programming, algorithm design, and model selection. 

Before Georgia Tech, I was a PhD student at the *University of Southern California*. My research involved molecular biology with some focus on leveraging Bioinformatics tools and techniques. Exploring complex biological data enlighten my passion about the state-of-the-art science and technology, and encouraged me to pursue a Computer Science major to deepen my understanding and explore my passion for the field.
